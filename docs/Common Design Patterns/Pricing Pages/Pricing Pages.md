Pricing pages have a significant influence over user choices. A well-designed pricing page finds the sweet spot between visual appeal and straightforward information, ensuring users can easily make a purchase decision. It should also allow them to make comparisons, include customer testimonials, and provide accessible support via features like live chat.  
Going beyond standard practices, effective pricing pages are customized to the specific product and its intended users. They are indispensable tools for businesses aiming to engage and convert visitors into buyers.  
**EXERCISE #1**  
**Show the most prominent plan features**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Overwhelming users with tons of features and various benefits within a pricing table increases the cognitive load. The more options users have, the more overwhelmed they feel, and the longer it takes for them to make a choice.  
A better approach is to mention the most important features and cut off the less prominent ones. Don't forget to add enough space between options to make them stand out and enhance legibility. Add visual accents via fonts, color, and graphic elements to aid users in comparing and scanning pricing plans.  
**Pro Tip:** If users need more detail, you can offer an expanded table through a button or link, or send them to a full pricing page with a deeper breakdown of all features.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #2**  
**Use sticky headers for pricing tiers**  
##   
  
  
  
  
If your pricing page contains extensive information that requires vertical scrolling, it's wise to duplicate primary action buttons, such as "Upgrade Plan" or "Get Premium," both at the top and bottom of the page. This ensures a seamless user experience, allowing them to take action without having to navigate back and forth within the page.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #3**  
**Communicate the differences**  
##   
  
  
  
  
In pricing plan design, clarity and emphasis on the distinct value of each tier are crucial. Highlighting differences between plans enables users to make informed decisions swiftly. Start by outlining the unique features of each plan at the top of your pricing table. For instance, differentiate by offering 1 free project in the free plan, 3 projects in a starter plan, and unlimited projects in the pro plan.  
Below each plan, detail additional features that come with that specific tier. For example, the starter plan could include professional templates or advanced features not available in the free version. This method organizes information in a user-friendly way, making it easier for potential customers to understand the value they're getting at each level. By prioritizing differences and then expanding on the incremental benefits, you guide users towards the plan that best suits their needs, simplifying their decision-making process.++[[1]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-1)++  
**Pro Tip:** Make sure the feature list fits on a single page and isn't too long.   
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #4**  
**Emphasize plans thoughtfully**  
##   
  
  
  
  
When it comes to choosing between pricing plans, it's hard to predict users' behavior. However, some common strategies may help you decide on which plan to emphasize by default:  
* **The middle plan: **This plan typically follows a free option, is priced lower than the premium one, and tends to be a popular choice. Users often gravitate towards something in between.  
* **The plan that fits most needs: **Conduct thorough research and engage with your users to identify which plan aligns best with their requirements. Labeling it as the "Top Choice" can assist other users in making decisions more swiftly.  
* **The plan that offers a free trial:** Offering a free trial is a proven way to capture user interest. Highlighting a plan with this feature demonstrates that you prioritize their experience and value, not just profit.  
To ensure these choices stand out, adjust the font size and weight, apply a distinctive color, or even add checkmarks.  
**Pro Tip:** Don't overdo it by adding too many visuals and highlights. When everything seems important, nothing is important.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #5**  
**Strive for a legible and simple style**  
##   
  
  
  
  
When a page is overloaded with information, users can struggle to distinguish between essential and less important content. This can lead to frustration and a sense of being lost in a sea of information.  
To address this, aim for a simplistic design that eliminates visual clutter and keeps users focused on their primary goal. Opt for simple and legible fonts. Stick to a limited color palette that enhances readability and maintains a cohesive visual theme. This ensures that users can easily absorb information without any unnecessary distractions.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #6**  
**Illustrate the difference**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Graphics in pricing tables are not only for visual appeal but also for communicating each plan's message and its features. A picture is worth a thousand words, and users should understand the value and difference between plans at a glance with the help of images or illustrations.  
Moreover, incorporating elements of playfulness, such as interactive buttons, drag-and-drop features, sliders, and other engaging elements, encourages users to spend more time on the pricing page.   
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #7**  
**Use meaningful pricing plan names**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Using descriptive plan names and clear, concise descriptions is essential for guiding users to make informed decisions quickly. For instance, instead of labeling a plan as "Standard" or "Advanced," consider a name like "Basic Website" and "E-commerce Powerhouse." These names immediately convey the purpose and benefits of each plan.  
Then, complement these names with straightforward descriptions, such as "Our Basic Website plan includes essential features for small businesses" and "The E-commerce Powerhouse plan is tailored for online stores with advanced tools for growth." Users can now grasp the differences and advantages of each plan more easily, enabling them to make conscious decisions that align with their specific needs.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #8**  
**Limit options**  
##   
  
  
  
  
While offering a wide array of pricing plans may seem appealing, it can lead to decision paralysis for users. To aid users in making a choice, narrow down their options.++[[2]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-2)++  
You might initially consider offering 3 plans, but even this is a somewhat arbitrary decision. A more effective approach is to engage in user testing. This involves seeking feedback from your audience to determine the optimal number of pricing plans.  
Remember to focus on the value each plan provides and the factors that motivate users to make a purchase.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #9**  
**Eliminate cost-related concerns**  
##   
  
When designing pricing pages, it's crucial for designers to address cost-related concerns to build trust and clarity for users. A well-structured Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) section can be a game-changer. By anticipating and answering common questions about pricing, billing cycles, and any additional costs, FAQs can significantly reduce user anxiety.++[[3]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-3)++  
Incorporating clear, straightforward information about money-back guarantees and offering free trials also play a vital role. This not only demonstrates confidence in the product but also provides a safety net for users. It reassures them that their investment is risk-free and that their satisfaction is a top priority.  
Remember, the goal is to make the pricing page as transparent and informative as possible. Users should leave feeling informed and secure in their decision, not confused or apprehensive.  
**Pro Tip:** For less common questions, encourage users to get in touch with you directly via email or phone or guide them towards a live chat for prompt assistance.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #10**  
**Provide quick help**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Live chat support is a powerful tool for providing users with immediate and professional assistance. It allows users the opportunity to carefully frame their questions in writing and even multitask while conversing with a representative. This tends to be more time-efficient compared to seeking support via email.  
Along with live chat, it's also wise to provide a phone number for users who prefer verbal communication over written exchanges. This diverse approach ensures that users can reach out in the way that suits them best, fostering a sense of trust and reliability.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #11**  
**Arrange pricing plans based on user benefits**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Research shows that people are more likely to choose the first option they see when they're aligned in a left-right order.++[[4]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-4)++ Some designers and marketers may be tempted to employ a dark pattern by rearranging pricing plans from expensive to cheap, hoping to draw attention to the higher-priced options. However, this approach can erode trust and potentially harm a company's reputation. When users encounter the highest prices first, they may perceive the remaining plans as less appealing.  
Instead, make decisions based on a more long-term approach. Arrange pricing plans based on the benefits and features that genuinely assist users in achieving their goals. This user-centric approach not only fosters trust but also demonstrates a commitment to providing value and support, ultimately strengthening the company's reputation in the eyes of its customers.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #12**  
**Make the CTAs stand out**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Opt for specific and value-driven button labels rather than vague ones like "Buy Now." Labels like "Get Pro" or "Choose Team" are more compelling as they clearly indicate the benefits users will receive upon clicking.  
Moreover, it's crucial to ensure that the CTA button is easily noticeable, appears clickable, and doesn't overlap with other elements on the page. This ensures a seamless and user-friendly experience.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #13**  
**Enhance credibility with testimonials**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Testimonials act as powerful endorsements for your product or service, instilling confidence in potential customers. They serve as a stamp of approval, motivating users to make a purchase. A good testimonial is specific, highlights real results, and is attributed to a recognizable source.  
Display testimonials prominently and consider using visuals like photos or videos to enhance credibility. Keep them concise and ensure they address common concerns or benefits to resonate with a wider audience.

The signup process is often the very start of the user journey, while the login process is an ongoing part of it. Making both as smooth as possible increases user conversion and retention.  
If users run into obstacles while signing up, they’re likely to abandon the process entirely. And if they run into them while trying to log back into their account, they may look to your competition.  
Following a few best practices for creating efficient, effective signup and login forms will mean more users completing these processes.  
**EXERCISE #1**  
**Limit signing up to one page**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Don’t add extra steps to your signup process. Keep it to a single page, with a minimum number of fields required to set up an account. The longer the form is, or the more steps it takes to complete it, the more likely users will get frustrated or hit a roadblock during the process.++[[1]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-1)++ Keep the essential inputs (username and password) and drop the rest.  
You can always ask users for more information later contextually. For instance, if your platform offers personalized recommendations, you could prompt users to specify their preferences after they've created their account.  
**Pro Tip:** Don't make users navigate to a new page to sign up when you can embed the form in their current page.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #2**  
**Differentiate login and signup**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Failing to differentiate between login and signup may create confusion for users. They could end up trying to log in with the registration form or vice versa. Frustrating your users definitely won’t lead to higher conversion rates. To prevent this, use separate pages for logging in and signing up.  
Make sure users understand how to switch between pages. Place the "Don't have an account? Sign Up" text below the form, so it's easy to spot but doesn't steal users' attention from the main content.  
**Pro Tip:** Make sure the signup and login forms link to one another so that it’s easy for users to switch between the two functions.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #3**  
**Allow signing up with social media profiles**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Nearly 80% of users favor social logins for any website. That’s good news since nearly 90% of users are frustrated by constantly having to set up new accounts.++[[2]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-2)++  
Social login lets users use their existing Facebook, Twitter, Google, LinkedIn, or other social media logins to create an account on your site. It drastically speeds up the registration process and greatly reduces the risk that they’ll forget their login information when returning to your site.  
However, keep in mind that social logins can raise privacy concerns while offering limited user control over their data.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #4**  
**Make a descriptive welcome page**  
##   
  
  
  
  
You need to give users a compelling reason to sign up for your product. Make it clear to them what the advantages of creating an account are to increase the likelihood that they’ll create an account. Welcome screens are an ideal place to remind them of the benefits they’ll get by signing up.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #5**  
**Make your CTAs easy to spot**  
##   
  
  
  
  
In many digital products, the login and signup pages serve as the gateway to the user experience. They're not just initial steps; they're critical touchpoints that can make or break the user's perception of your design. Therefore, the placement of the login and signup buttons is vital.  
While the exact "sweet spot" might vary depending on your layout and user flow, a common best practice is to position these buttons where they are immediately visible and accessible — often in the site's header or upper navigation area. This reduces the cognitive load on users and makes it straightforward for them to take action, whether they're new to your platform or returning for another session.  
**Pro Tip:** The main brand color can come in handy here to draw users' attention to the Log In and Sign Up buttons.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #6**  
**Avoid similar-looking wording for button labels**  
##   
  
  
  
  
The call-to-action (CTA) labels on your login and signup buttons are more than just placeholders; they guide users through the initial steps of their experience with your product. While "sign in" and "sign up" may seem sufficiently distinct, the similarity can lead to users clicking the wrong button. So, let's be crystal clear and opt for terms that are visually distinguishable at a glance, like "log in" and "sign up" or "register."  
**Pro Tip:** You can also experiment with more descriptive or engaging labels, such as "Join the Community" for sign-up or "Welcome Back" for login. Just ensure the terms are clear and straightforward.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #7**  
**Utilize button hierarchy**  
##   
  
  
  
  
While the actions of logging in and signing up serve different functions, they're often placed together on a platform's interface. Therefore, employing a distinct button hierarchy is vital for reducing user errors and enhancing navigability.  
Button hierarchy isn't merely an aesthetic choice; it serves a functional purpose. Utilize contrasting colors, size variance, and strategic positioning to differentiate between the two actions clearly. For instance, a prominent Log In button on the login page could use a brand's primary color, while the Sign-Up option might appear in a more muted shade or as a text button.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #8**  
**Allow multiple login options**  
##   
  
  
  
  
While usernames offer a layer of privacy, they are often more difficult to remember than email addresses or phone numbers, especially if they're not frequently used. This can result in failed login attempts and, eventually, user frustration or even account abandonment.  
By offering a variety of login options such as email, phone number, or even social media accounts, you give users the flexibility to choose the method most convenient for them. This reduces friction, improves user satisfaction, and helps retain users in the long run.++[[3]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-3)++  
Including an option to log in via a username is still valuable, but it should be just that— an option, not a requirement.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #9**  
**Allow users to reveal the password**  
##   
  
  
  
  
It’s so easy to make a mistake when inputting a password, especially on mobile devices. Add the option to show a password so that users can make sure they typed what they meant to. An eye icon in or near the password field is the most common way to let users do this. Ensure that it works both ways and allows them to hide their password again.  
**Pro Tip:** Always hide the password by default.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #10**  
**Provide security of user data**  
##   
  
Offering users the convenience of remembering their login credentials can make the experience smoother. On platforms where repeated entry is common, this feature can cut down on user frustration significantly.  
However, for websites where the stakes are high in terms of security, like banking or healthcare platforms, there's a need to strike a balance. While it may not be advisable to keep users always logged in, you can offer to remember their username. This speeds up the login process without compromising security.  
To bolster this approach, consider implementing an additional layer of authorization, such as two-factor authentication (2FA). When users attempt to log in, a unique code could be sent to their registered email or phone number, ensuring that the person attempting to log in is indeed the account owner. This allows for a blend of convenience and security that enhances the overall user experience.  
**Pro Tip:** When security is a major priority, obscuring part of the username with asterisks makes the login process faster while also protecting users.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #11**  
**Prevent user errors**  
##   
  
  
  
  
As users input their details, use inline validation to instantly provide real-time feedback, flagging potential errors or discrepancies. This helps prevent mistakes before they occur, such as mistyped passwords or incomplete fields.  
Additionally, consider providing a password requirement checklist underneath the password input field, so users don't have to struggle to create a password. This can include prompts for using a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

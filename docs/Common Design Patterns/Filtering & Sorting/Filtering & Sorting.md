Contrary to the belief that more options are always better, an overwhelming number of choices can lead to frustration and indecision. This, in turn, prolongs the decision-making process and, ultimately, prompts users to leave an online store empty-handed and dissatisfied. This is why filtering and sorting mechanisms are crucial, particularly for online stores with extensive catalogs. These features assist users in refining search results, locating desired items, and completing a purchase quickly and efficiently.  
Learning how to design effective filtering and sorting controls can yield significant results in terms of usability and conversion rates for your product.  
**EXERCISE #1**  
**Allow users to clear all filters**  
##   
  
  
  
  
It's quite common for users to apply multiple filters in their search for specific content. However, this can sometimes lead to a very narrow set of results. Additionally, users may change their minds and wish to search for something entirely different.  
While it's helpful to be able to remove filters one by one, it can be quite laborious and time-intensive to go through and remove each applied filter individually. Providing a feature that allows users to clear all filters with a single click can be a significant time-saver and convenience, especially for those shopping on mobile devices.  
**Pro Tip:** The Clear All button should appear subtle but not look disabled. Make sure the button changes state on hover or click so users know they can interact with it.   
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #2**  
**Allow sorting when searching**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Many users confuse the terminology for filtering and sorting options and sometimes use them interchangeably. However, the difference is significant. Filters set hard boundaries so that the page shows items that strictly match the specific selected criteria. Sorting sets soft boundaries. Instead of excluding items, it arranges them in a specific order.  
**According to the Baymard Institute's studies, users often are more inclined to use sorting. This is because:**  
* Users are afraid to lose relevant products that fall just outside their defined filter range.  
* Users may not know the product's domain or technical characteristics well enough to set the filtering criteria.  
* Users may not be so sure about their budgetary limitations, compatibility requirements, usage conditions, etc., and prefer browsing until they find out what they like.++[[1]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-1)++  
Ultimately, users need both filtering and sorting functionalities to find relevant content. So make sure you provide both.  
**Pro Tip:** Provide the most popular options to sort — by the highest and lowest price, rating, recency, and popularity.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #3**  
**Display the number of matching results**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Displaying the number of available search results when users apply filters helps them get a clear understanding of how many items match their criteria. In addition to placing this information near the filters, consider incorporating it into the Apply button.  
By doing so, you effectively reduce the interaction cost for users by limiting the steps users take to achieve their desired outcome, such as finding a specific product.++[[2]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-2)++ For instance, when the number of items found is too small or even zero, users might not proceed to click the Apply button immediately. They may first remove a few filters in an attempt to broaden their search and potentially see more results. This additional step can be a significant factor in user satisfaction and ultimately lead to more successful searches and purchases.  
**Pro Tip:** When no filters are selected, the button should read “Show all [total] products” by default.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #4**  
**Conceal filters to optimize space on mobile**  
##   
  
  
  
  
When it comes to mobile apps, displaying all available filters directly on the screen can potentially obstruct other important content. To prevent this, initially conceal the filters behind a designated Filter button. This button should be strategically positioned above the search results.  
Upon clicking the Filter button, users can then access the filter options. This action expands the menu or directs them to a separate page dedicated solely to filter choices. It ensures that filters remain accessible but do not overwhelm or clutter the initial screen, allowing users to focus on the content they're interested in.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #5**  
**Horizontal filter panel**  
##   
  
  
  
  
When users are on the lookout for specific items, they often apply numerous filters. Horizontal filter panels are a great solution for this purpose.  
Unlike the sidebar, horizontal panels are more attention-grabbing. However, it's worth noting that horizontal filtering does have a limitation — space. If your website hosts multiple filters, expanding them horizontally may consume a substantial portion of the screen, necessitating users to scroll to view the results.++[[3]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-3)++   
To mitigate this, prioritize essential filters like price and brand, keeping them visible, while the others can be tucked away. This ensures a balanced approach, offering necessary filtering options without overwhelming the user interface.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #6**  
**Vertical filter panel**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Vertical filter panels are a classic and widely recognized filtering tool. Unlike their horizontal counterparts, vertical panels can accommodate large numbers of filter groups, which makes them particularly suitable for desktop devices.  
However, vertical filter panels take up valuable horizontal space, and research from the Baymard Institute shows that users sometimes overlook them entirely++[[4]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-4)++. On the other hand, horizontal panels can leave more space for product cards in a row, but they also tend to push the product grid lower on the page. This reduces what users see immediately above the fold, and a large filter block at the top can feel discouraging.  
Space efficiency is therefore not measured only by the number of items that fit in a row. It is also about composition, balance, and visibility. The choice of filter panel type should depend on your requirements, the space available, and the number of filter options you need to support.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #7**  
**Showcase the most popular filter options upfront**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Showcasing the most popular filter options upfront in UI design not only makes navigation smoother and more intuitive, but it also saves users' time and accurately reflects their needs. To determine which filters are the most popular, designers can:  
* Regularly review user interaction data to identify trends and preferences.  
* Gather direct feedback through user testing or surveys, gaining valuable insights into the filters users find most useful.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #8**  
**Grouping categories**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Imagine you're on an e-commerce website looking for a new pair of sneakers. If you're presented with a long, unorganized list of filters, it would be quite challenging to quickly find what you're looking for. You might need to look multiple times to locate the specific parameter you're interested in. This can be frustrating and time-consuming for users.  
This is where the concept of grouping filters comes into play. Instead of displaying all the filters in a single, overwhelming list, you can organize them based on common features. For example, in the case of sneakers, you might have filters like size, color, brand, price range, and material.  
**Pro Tip:** Use negative space and dividers to create visual separation between groups.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #9**  
**Allow multiple selection**  
##   
  
  
  
  
When searching for specific criteria, like vacation lodging for a large group, there's often a need for multiple selections within a single filter category. For instance, you might require multiple beds, pet-friendly, smoking allowed, wifi, air conditioning, breakfast, and nearby dining options.  
Functionally, radio buttons allow only one selection. Unless the options eliminate each other, checkboxes provide a more flexible search. So make sure your filters incorporate checkboxes for categories where multiple options can be selected.  
**Pro Tip:** Use visually standard checkboxes — a small square with a checkmark or an (X) when selected.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #10**  
**Use the right words for filter labels**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Using appropriate terminology for filter labels is crucial for user comprehension. Labels should reflect familiar, widely used language to ensure clarity and ease of navigation. For example, opt for terms like "Fabric" instead of technical jargon like "Textile."  
Engaging with users or conducting research helps identify the terms they commonly use. This practice minimizes confusion, ensuring a seamless browsing experience and aiding users in finding what they seek.  
**Pro Tip:** Look through product reviews or conduct short interviews to learn words your users actually use in conversation about products or categories.   
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #11**  
**Display applied filters in an overview**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Research tells us that websites should display applied filters twice — by adding a checkmark in the selected option's checkbox and by providing an overview.++[[5]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-5)++  
Utilize tags to present applied filters in a clear overview. They summarize the chosen criteria, offering users a quick reference for their selections. This enhances user awareness of their active filters and facilitates easy removal or adjustment, streamlining the browsing experience.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #12**  
**Allow users to change views**  
##   
  
  
  
  
People have diverse ways of processing information. For swift scanning of numerous options, a list view is effective. It allows users to quickly skim through. On the other hand, the grid view offers larger images and concise product information, providing a snapshot before users delve into the product page for detailed information. Offering these various view options grants more flexibility to users.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #13**  
**Reduce the interaction cost**  
##   
  
  
  
  
When designing filter panels, try to minimize the interaction cost for your users. Avoid forcing them to save each filter preference individually or requiring excessive button clicks. Employ intuitive icons and tooltips for clarity, and consider implementing auto-updating of results as filters are applied or removed. Keeping the user experience smooth and friction-free is paramount in enhancing usability and satisfaction among your users.  
However, auto-updating filters may not be suitable for complex tasks involving extremely large data sets, pagination, or heavy server load. In such cases, an explicit Apply button can prevent performance issues and poor user experience.

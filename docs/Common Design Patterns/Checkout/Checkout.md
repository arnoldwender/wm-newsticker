The checkout page is the final step in the process of making a purchase on an e-commerce website. It's where users enter their shipping and payment information and confirm their order.  
A well-designed, intuitive checkout page can help increase conversions. A poorly designed and complicated checkout page, however, can have the opposite effect — users could abandon their carts and perhaps even your product. You can prevent this by employing a few simple best practices, all aimed at reducing friction and cognitive load for your users.  
**EXERCISE #1**  
**Display a progress tracker**  
##   
  
  
  
  
It doesn’t matter if your process spans one page or multiple pages, when more than a few steps are involved, give users an outline of what to expect using a progress tracker. This will let them know how far they’ve come and how many steps are left before the purchase is completed.  
Moreover, breaking down forms into multiple steps or pages makes them more digestible and reduces the cognitive load required to fill them out.  
Another single-page alternative to progress trackers is fitting all the steps of the checkout process under an accordion menu on one page. As users complete each step, they’ll scroll down and move on to the next one while knowing exactly how many steps are left.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #2**  
**Remove distractions**  
##   
  
  
  
  
The point of any checkout page is to get users to complete a purchase. Anything that steers them away from this goal is a distraction — and that includes top navigation bars and footers with links.  
**Keep these pointers in mind:**  
* Minimize links to keep users on the page. Include essentials only, like a link for live customer support.  
* Enable item modification directly on the checkout page.  
* Eliminate ads and pop-ups for a seamless experience.  
* Instead of promo links, use copy-paste promo codes that don't redirect users to another page.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #3**  
**Single-name vs separate name fields**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Should you use a single “Full Name” field or separate "First Name" and "Last Name" fields in the checkout process? It depends entirely on the context. Using a single name field can be a more user-oriented approach, especially in a global context. It can speed up the form-filling process, reducing friction. It can eliminate confusion in cultures where the name is handled differently, such as in Japan, Korea, and Romania, where the family name comes before the first name. A single name field also simplifies the process and minimizes user errors on mobile devices where space is a constraint and typing is difficult.  
However, using separate fields for first and last names can facilitate more personalized communication in marketing, like emails or push notifications. For example, addressing someone as "Hey John" feels more personal than "Hi John Connor." Also, certain industries with strong identification requirements, such as medical, government, or financial sectors, may require names to be stored separately. Some technical systems or APIs might necessitate first and last names to be distinct for functionality purposes.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #4**  
**Ensure address hierarchy**  
##   
  
  
  
  
When dealing with international or even national shipping, it makes sense to put the country/state name first for checkout. Many fields, such as address or phone number, are region-specific, so knowing the country/state ensures you only ask for relevant information.  
Since address formats could be different in different regions, provide users with tools to speed up the process. Indicate the meaning of each required input with a label and example placeholder text, such as street name or apartment number.  
**Pro Tip:** Make sure to display the correct currencies, units of measurement, and formats for phone numbers and addresses for different countries.   
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #5**  
**Write clear error messages**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Errors are inevitable in any product — what really matters is how helpful you are towards guiding your users out of these error states. According to the Nielsen Norman Group, the principles that go into a good error message are pretty straightforward — keep the language explicit, concise, polite, precise, constructive, and human.++[[1]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-1)++  
Errors can also occur on the part of users — for example, a mistyped postal code or a non-existent email address. In this case, avoid blaming users for their mistakes and let them know what went wrong and how to fix it. Better yet, make your microcopy on form labels, placeholder text, and CTAs unmistakably clear, in turn cutting down the chances of errors happening.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #6**  
**Provide inline validation**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Any form that waits until after a user clicks on Submit to point out any errors is likely to be abandoned by them. To prevent this, offer inline validation on every input field of your form so that users know immediately when they make a mistake and what they should do to correct it. Don’t just flag failed validations, but also indicate successfully completed ones as well. It's a huge time saver, reduces friction, and imparts trust in the system.++[[2]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-2)++  
Delay inline validation until the user completes their input and shifts the cursor out of the input field. Immediate validation, triggered as users start typing, may be perceived as intrusive or disruptive, potentially causing annoyance.  
**Pro Tip:** Indicate erroneous and successful inputs using prominent, contrasting colors (usually red and green) and a relevant icon.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #7**  
**Enable autofill**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Whenever possible, allow users to autofill payment details. Use browser autofill for common form fields such as name, address, email ID, phone number, and password. Enable browser-saved data for card details too, along with options like credit card scanning and quick API integration.  
Make it easier for users by enabling autofill for one-time passwords (OTPs) received during payment processes. This reduces interaction costs and prevents the hassle of toggling between pages.  
While autofill enhances user convenience, ensure robust security measures are in place to protect sensitive information. Regularly update your security protocols to guard against data breaches, and consider multi-factor authentication for additional safety.  
**Pro Tip:** On mobile, make sure user data is safe by encrypting it and using fingerprint or face scan for sensitive info like payment details.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #8**  
**Allow guest checkout**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Studies suggest that delaying account creation for users is in your best interest. Immediately pushing users to sign up can be intimidating and put them off.++[[3]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-3)++ To speed up purchases, allow them to checkout as guests. Ensure the “checkout as a guest” option is the most prominent option on the account selection step and that users can easily find it.  
**Pro Tip:** Enable one-click social sign-up and sign-in to make registration and logging in hassle-free.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #9**  
**Summarize the order details**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Add a summary section to your checkout page with details of every product in the cart: product image, quantity, product page link, most relevant features, and price included. This includes delivery charges and taxes. Not doing so and only displaying the final price will cause users to trust your website less — so let them know what they’ll be paying for with full transparency. Displaying the estimated delivery time alongside each product in the cart is a plus.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #10**  
**Allow different payment options**  
##   
  
  
  
  
According to Baymard Institute studies, 9% of users abandon a website due to the lack of convenient payment methods.++[[4]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-4)++ When users trust your website enough to share their payment details and make a purchase, reward them by making it easy, trustworthy, and seamless.  
Provide as many payment links as possible. That being said, offering more methods is costly. Prioritize the most popular methods first, expanding the options as your business grows, and scaling becomes feasible.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #11**  
**Simplify card number input**  
##   
  
  
  
  
When collecting card details from users for payment, use smart defaults and foresee potential errors that users might make. Ensure the debit/credit card number layout follows the input mask format. It automatically formats spaces in the card number field, making it easier for users to check what they are typing.  
Once users select their country, make the system fetch the corresponding currency — it saves time and effort and helps prevent mistakes. By not confusing users with prices, you foster trust and create a positive impression about your brand.  
Another best practice that can be applied to filling in the card number input is to allow the system to detect the card type automatically. It can be implemented by checking the first four digits so users don’t have to select it manually.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #12**  
**Add visual signs of security**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Although most users form an opinion about a site's security based on their gut feeling, designers can reinforce this feeling of trust by ensuring the website has the following:  
* **Security badges or trust seals: **"SSL seals" issued by SSL certificate vendors like Norton, Thawte, Trustwave, Geotrust, or Comodo denote secure communication between a browser and a site. Furthermore, trust seals like Google Trusted Store, BBB Accredited, and TRUSTe indicate to users the business is legit and that they can trust it.  
* **A padlock icon and HTTPS protocol: **The HTTPS protocol provides a layer of encryption that can help ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between a web browser of users and a website. A tiny detail such as a padlock icon can also provide enough visual security cues to increase users' perception of security.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #13**  
**Provide order confirmation after payment**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Don’t leave your users hanging after they’ve placed their order and made the payment. Let them know you’ve received it and are processing it with a confirmation screen.++[[5]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-5)++  
**Don’t forget to send out a detailed confirmation email that covers the:**  
* Order summary  
* Final price and cost breakdown  
* Estimated date of delivery  
* Order tracking details (if applicable)  
* Customer support details  
* Registration option for guest checkouts  
**Pro Tip:** Making the checkout experience better is a long and ongoing process, and these best practices are only a first step. Don’t forget to test your page with your target audience and iterate until you arrive at a design that works best for your product.

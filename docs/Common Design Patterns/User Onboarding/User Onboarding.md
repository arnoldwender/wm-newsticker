If you want people to become devoted users of your product, the last thing you should do is leave them to figure out how to use it on their own. Onboarding is the process of guiding new users through a series of interactions and instructions to help them get familiar with the product.  
By following onboarding best practices, you'll have users who are more engaged and eager to use your product again, instead of being confused about what it can do for them.  
**EXERCISE #1**  
**Walkthroughs**  
##   
  
Walkthroughs are a standard way to introduce apps to new users, typically through swipeable static screens. But, they're not without their pitfalls. Primarily, they hinder immediate interaction with the app by presenting information upfront, which can overwhelm and soon be forgotten by users. This method, although common in every other app, blocks the real experience of using the product.  
To enhance the effectiveness of walkthroughs, here are some key tips:  
* **Focus on necessity: **Avoid using walkthroughs to explain the app's value proposition. Users downloading the app usually have a grasp of its benefits.  
* **Keep it brief:** Ideally, use a maximum of three slides. This helps in retaining user attention without overloading them.  
* **Engage with animation:** Introduce animation to make walkthroughs more dynamic and engaging.  
* **Empower user choice:** Always include a 'Skip' button, allowing users to opt out and explore the app directly.  
**Pro Tip:** If screens are visually appealing, users are more likely to complete the onboarding. Nevertheless, give users the option to skip it.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #2**  
**Interactive tour**  
##   
  
Interactive tours in user onboarding offer a hands-on approach to learning. Unlike static instructions, these tours are activated at specific points in the user's journey, providing contextual and practical guidance. For instance, Duolingo utilizes this technique, inviting users to take a test in their chosen language, thereby demonstrating the app's key functionalities through actual use.++[[1]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-1)++  
Here are some tips for crafting interactive tours:  
* **Trigger contextually:** Initiate tours at relevant points in the user journey for maximum relevance.  
* **Encourage active participation:** Let users complete tasks themselves for better engagement and understanding.  
* **Mimic real tasks: **Ensure the tasks in the tour reflect real actions users will perform, aligning the onboarding experience with practical use.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #3**  
**Contextual tips**  
##   
  
Contextual tips in user onboarding are targeted, minimal guidance cues provided to users as they interact with an app. The key is not to overwhelm users with excessive instructions.  
Here are a few tips for effectively using contextual tips:  
* **Less is more:** Avoid cluttering the screen with tips for every action. Too many tips can be counterproductive, distracting, and overwhelming.  
* **One at a time:** Show only one tip at a time to keep the user focused and avoid information overload.  
* **Intuitive design first:** If your product requires numerous tips, it might be time to reconsider the UI design. Aim for an intuitive interface that minimizes the need for explanatory tips.  
* **Make it relevant:** Ensure that each tip is contextually relevant to the user's current action or screen. Irrelevant tips can confuse rather than help.  
**Pro Tip:** Too many tips can overwhelm and annoy users, so avoid using them for obvious functions.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #4**  
**Checklist walkthrough**  
##   
  
A checklist walkthrough is a user onboarding process where new users are guided through a series of tasks presented as a checklist. Users can track their progress, enhancing a sense of accomplishment and familiarity with the platform.  
It's best used when introducing users to essential features, guiding them through key functionalities, and ensuring they understand the product's value proposition.  
**Pro Tip:** Keep walkthrough checklists short as they can appear achievable and gently nudge users.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #5**  
**Make the introduction quick**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Don’t bombard new users with a ton of questions when you start onboarding. Asking for too many details before you’ve built trust and enthusiasm with those users feels like an imposition. Respect your users’ time and efforts by only asking for the minimum amount of information required to use the product, while also clearly identifying the value users will get.  
**Pro Tip:** Be sure to give users the option to close or skip onboarding questions.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #6**  
**Persona-based questions**  
##   
  
If you’ve created a product that could be used by different personas, it’s important to get an idea of which persona each of your users fits into. This allows you to optimize their experience, thereby turning them into more loyal users.++[[2]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-2)++  
For example, imagine you've created a project management tool that caters to both individual freelancers and large-scale enterprise teams. Through persona-based onboarding questions, you can prompt users with queries like:  
**What best describes your role or work setup?**  
A) Freelancer or solo contributor  
B) Team member or manager in a company  
**What is the size of your typical project team?**  
A) 1-3 members  
B) 4 or more members  
Based on their responses, you can then tailor the onboarding process accordingly.   
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #7**  
**Nudge users to fill empty states**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Empty states can be confusing to users, especially if there’s no indication of what they’re supposed to do to fill those screens. Use this opportunity to guide users and help them complete a task, such as setting up their first project. If this is the first time they’re using your product, adding a quick tutorial or a short video creates a better user experience.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #8**  
**Encourage users to build habits**  
##   
  
  
  
  
If you’ve ever tried to build a new habit like jogging daily or eating more vegetables, you know how much effort it can take. Occasionally nudging users to interact can turn using your product into a habit. Engage them to invite friends, reward them for daily usage, or notify them about updates and new content. These actions will reinforce the habit and keep them coming back.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #9**  
**Keep the onboarding process short and sweet**  
##   
  
  
  
  
If your onboarding feels more like a lecture than a quick tour, users likely won't find it helpful and will skip it entirely. 4-5 screens are usually enough to provide an efficient product or feature overview. Keep users engaged by making the walkthrough concise and focusing on the most exciting features.  
According to a study, a majority of users believe that the onboarding process should take 60 seconds or less.++[[3]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-3)++ Otherwise, they get bored and tend to leave.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #10**  
**Reduce friction whenever possible**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Let users know how many steps the onboarding process will take and give them an indication of where they are in that process. When users know exactly what to expect, it reduces friction and increases the likelihood that they'll complete the steps necessary.

Email marketing continues to be a potent tool for reaching and engaging potential customers. With a staggering 4 billion daily email users worldwide, this channel's influence is set to grow even further in the coming years.++[[1]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-1)++  
But how can your business effectively convert these users into loyal customers? There are various strategies to capture emails on your website. Consider implementing personalized sign-up pages, engaging pop-up invitations, unobtrusive floating bars, and interactive forms, to name just a few. Knowing the best practices will help you reach out to customers without annoying them or interrupting their time on your website.  
**EXERCISE #1**  
**Avoid confirmshaming**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Confirmshaming is a dark pattern that involves guilting users into opting for something.++[[2]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-2)++ For example, imagine a health newsletter popup that asks users to subscribe and offers 2 CTAs: "Yes, I want to improve my health" and "No, I don't care about my health." This is an obvious play on users' emotions.  
Instead of resorting to guilt-based tactics, it's far more effective to offer users something of genuine value. Provide them with a compelling incentive like an e-book, an exclusive discount, or valuable tips as a reward for subscribing. This will ensure that your product attracts a loyal audience that is genuinely interested in your content.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #2**  
**Keep it simple**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Make it simple to sign up for your email list. There is no need to ask your users about everything when offering a subscription. In fact, the more information you request, the less likely users are to get to the end of the form. Aim to reduce the number of inputs to the bare minimum.  
Usually, an email alone is enough for the subscription. You can also ask for a name to make your emails sound more personal.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #3**  
**Set clear expectations**  
##   
  
  
  
  
It's crucial that users have a clear understanding of what they're signing up for when they join your email list. They should know exactly what kind of valuable information they can expect to receive and how frequently they'll be hearing from you.  
However, it's important not to overwhelm potential subscribers with too much detail; keep the description straightforward and to the point. This transparency not only builds trust with your audience but also sets clear expectations and leads to a more engaged and satisfied subscriber base.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #4**  
**Reduce efforts to subscribe**  
##   
  
  
  
  
The principle is simple — the smoother and more straightforward the subscription process, the higher the likelihood that users will complete it. Each additional step introduces a potential barrier, which can deter users from reaching their destination.  
Consider this when designing your subscription flow. For instance, rather than triggering a popup window after users click the Subscribe button, you can streamline the process by positioning the input field for their information in close proximity to the button. This small adjustment can save users valuable time and reduce friction in their journey towards subscribing.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #5**  
**Mark the exit**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Even if your emails offer valuable content, there will be some users who want to opt out. This could be due to reasons like receiving too many emails or a shift in their interests where your information is no longer relevant to them. In such cases, it's crucial not to retain subscribers against their wishes.  
To respect your users' preferences, ensure that the option to unsubscribe is prominently displayed. Make the process of unsubscribing clear and straightforward. Demonstrating this level of transparency leaves a positive impression, and there's a chance that users may return in the future. Conversely, attempting to deceive them into staying can lead to frustration and potentially harm your relationship with them.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #6**  
**Make unsubscribing easy**  
##   
  
  
  
  
The process of unsubscribing from an email list should be as straightforward as the process of subscribing, if not easier. Introducing unnecessary steps is a form of the roach motel dark pattern, where entry is simple, but exit is needlessly complicated.++[[3]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-3)++  
It's important to refrain from requiring users to log in or complete lengthy surveys as a prerequisite for unsubscribing. Instead, allow them to leave without hurdles. This not only respects their wishes but also creates a more positive experience. Should they ever wish to return, this approach leaves the door open for them.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #7**  
**Avoid being pushy**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Don't compel users to provide feedback when they're unsubscribing. Instead, consider it as an optional and voluntary action. Users may find themselves in situations where they're pressed for time, not in the best mood, or simply in a circumstance where typing out feedback is inconvenient. Regardless of their specific reasons, it's crucial to value and respect their time.  
Opting for an optional feedback process also benefits you. It ensures that the insights you receive are more likely to be relevant and meaningful. When feedback is made mandatory, users may be inclined to type random or hasty responses just to fulfill the requirement, which may not offer genuine insights.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #8**  
**Offer a friendly goodbye**  
##   
  
  
  
  
The way you say goodbye to unsubscribing users matters. Make sure your goodbye message matches how you usually talk to your audience. If your style is friendly and relaxed, suddenly sounding very formal might seem strange.  
Also, avoid sounding upset or blaming users for leaving. Instead, be kind and friendly. This leaves a good impression. Even if users leave now, they might think positively about your brand and come back later.  
**Pro Tip:** How do you stay in touch with users after they've unsubscribed? Provide them with links to follow your social networks as part of your goodbye message.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #9**  
**Make the Subscribe button obvious**  
##   
  
  
  
  
Promote your subscription form in different areas on your website. Make the Subscribe button visible but not overlapping with other content or breaking the general hierarchy. Check your Google Analytics reports to figure out where people go after first landing on your site. Make sure to include a noticeable Subscribe button on these pages.++[[4]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-4)++  
Use a contrasting color for the Subscribe button against the background, and ensure it's appropriately sized for easy spotting. Additionally, add a compelling call-to-action like "Subscribe Now!' to draw immediate attention.  
**Pro Tip:** The header or footer of a website is usually a good spot to place the Subscribe button.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #10**  
**Use exit-intent popups**  
##   
  
Rather than bombarding users with subscription popups the moment they arrive on a page, consider employing less intrusive alternatives like a persistent CTA that stays visible as they scroll, or utilize exit-intent popups. Exit-intent popups are special modals that appear just as users are about to leave a website. This technology senses mouse movement and presents the popup precisely at that moment.  
These exit-intent subscription popups often present a special offer or other incentives designed to encourage users to subscribe before leaving. When used thoughtfully, they can be effective at increasing subscription conversions, with studies showing conversion rates of around 10–15% for users who would otherwise exit the site.++[[5]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-5)++

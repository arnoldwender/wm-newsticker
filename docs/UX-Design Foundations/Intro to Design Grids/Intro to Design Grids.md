Grids are one of the fundamental building blocks of a well-structured, organized design. They lend order to every other element in your design and guide you through creating a layout. Think of grids as guidelines for creating your layout.  
Understanding how the grid works is key to creating dynamic UI and a better user experience. On the other hand, gridless designs can feel disordered, confusing, and cluttered.  
**EXERCISE #1**  
**Grid**  
##   
  
In digital design, the grid is a network of straight vertical and horizontal lines laid out in a pattern. It's a key component in creating logical, organized layouts for all design formats in any orientation.  
Grids help designers align and structure content consistently throughout the project. With the help of design format properties (like golden ratio or active zones), grids maintain balance from page to page, enhance the visual hierarchy, and create focal points to guide user attention.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #2**  
**Columns**  
##   
  
Columns are vertical spatial areas that hold content within the grid. They are the most basic building blocks of a grid. The number of columns is defined upfront and may vary based on the device's size — desktop, tablet, or mobile.  
Depending on the grid's exact specs, the column's width scales proportionally to the available screen space. All content usually falls within the bounds of the columns (though content often bridges more than one column).++[[1]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-1)++ Some elements can "break the grid" to draw attention, but in most cases, try to align all of the grid's contents to a column.  
A 12-column grid is common for large viewports, while smaller viewports use fewer columns.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #3**  
**Rows**  
##   
  
In UI/UX design, rows serve as the horizontal counterpart to columns, adding a layer of structure and rhythm to your layout. While columns often get the spotlight for organizing content vertically, rows play a vital role in arranging elements horizontally across a page. They're versatile; their height can adjust based on the content they house.  
Although they may not be as commonly emphasized as columns, rows are essential for a balanced and easy-to-navigate design. Think of them as the horizontal guidelines that help users scan content effortlessly.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #4**  
**Gutters**  
##   
  
Between each column or row, you’ll find gutters. They are also called grid gaps in web development. Gutters are the spaces between columns and rows. They separate content and provide white space within your design, giving it room to breathe. Elements may bridge gutters when they occupy multiple columns or rows, but as a general rule, an element should not end in a gutter.  
To maintain a visual balance, gutters should always be equal between columns or rows. There are 3 gutter sizes: compact, cozy, and comfortable, each roomier than the previous one. You might be familiar with these terms from the display options in Gmail’s interface. Be careful using compact gutters, as they can add tension to your design.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #5**  
**Margins**  
##   
  
Margins are the empty spaces between the edges of the format and the content. They create white space around the content and vary according to screen size, either expanding or shrinking as it changes. The margin size gives the content a general shape, usually a rectangle.  
**Pro Tip:** Set the minimum margin so your grid doesn't bump up against the screen on smaller displays.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #6**  
**Modules**  
##   
  
Modules in a grid function like individual containers for your content. Think of them as the versatile LEGO blocks of your design framework. Created by the intersections of columns and rows, these modules hold elements like text, images, or buttons. Essentially, they help you compartmentalize different kinds of information and make your design more manageable.  
When users interact with your interface, these modules guide their visual journey, aiding in a more intuitive experience. So, while columns provide vertical structure and rows give you horizontal rhythm, modules are where the real action happens. They're where your content resides, organized neatly within the boundaries set by your grid.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #7**  
**Fixed grid**  
##   
  
Fixed grids refer to a type of layout structure in design where the content is positioned within a predetermined set of columns and rows, and these dimensions remain constant regardless of the screen size or device. This means that the layout's elements maintain a fixed placement and size, offering a consistent visual appearance across various devices.  
This approach is suitable for projects where content presentation needs to remain consistent, such as in print materials or websites with a specific design aesthetic. However, it's important to consider responsiveness and adaptability for different screen sizes when opting for fixed grids, as they may not always provide the best experience for users on all devices.  
**Pro Tip:** Design fixed layouts according to the most common screen resolutions among your target audience.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #8**  
**Fluid grid**  
##   
  
Fluid grids are a dynamic approach to web design that adapts content layout based on the user's screen size and device. Instead of rigidly fixed dimensions, elements within a fluid grid are sized proportionally, allowing them to scale smoothly from large desktop screens to smaller mobile displays. This ensures a consistent and visually appealing experience across various devices.  
Fluid grids are achieved through the use of relative units like percentages instead of fixed units like pixels. This responsive design technique helps prevent content from becoming cramped or stretched, creating a harmonious appearance no matter the screen size.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #9**  
**Responsive grid**  
##   
  
Like fluid grids, responsive grids adjust based on the screen size. Columns resize to fill the available space until a breakpoint is reached. A breakpoint is a screen width where the layout shifts to better fit the display. At each breakpoint, the column structure, column widths, gutter widths, and margins can change.  
Designing responsive grids requires more planning than fixed or fluid grids. Designers must decide at which screen sizes the grid should change and how it should adapt for the best user experience. When done well, a responsive grid often provides a better experience on small screens than fixed or fluid grids.  
**Pro Tip:** Choose fluid grids for proportional scaling across all screen sizes. Use responsive grids for more control over layout adjustments at specific breakpoints for an optimal user experience.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #10**  
**Baseline grid**  
##   
  
A baseline is the line where text sits. A baseline grid is a secondary type of grid that sits within every grid and helps designers to give a flowing rhythm to the text.  
The baseline grid contributes to the visual hierarchy, particularly when it comes to typography. Elements that take up more rows on the baseline grid (like headings and subheadings) have more visual weight and are viewed as more important.++[[2]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-2)++  
 Most designers stick to an 8-point baseline grid and use multiples of 4px for more precise adjustments in spacing or line height.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #11**  
**Fixed element**  
##   
  
Fixed elements maintain a consistent size, unaffected by changes in screen or grid dimensions. These stable components offer predictability but lack adaptability to varying external conditions. While they fit seamlessly into any grid type, it's crucial to ensure their presence harmonizes with other design elements.  
Consider using fixed elements for core branding components or essential interface sections that should remain constant for users across different devices or screen sizes. Always balance their use with the overall design flow to achieve a cohesive and user-friendly interface.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #12**  
**Fluid element**  
##   
  
Fluid elements adapt gracefully, resizing in harmony with screen changes to maintain a balanced design. Commonly used in both responsive and fluid grids, they ensure the interface remains consistent across various device sizes.  
When designing with fluid elements, it's essential to set minimum and maximum limits to prevent them from becoming too small to interact with or so large that they overpower the design. Consider using fluid elements for sections where scalability is key, such as adaptable content containers or interface components that should offer a seamless experience across multiple devices.

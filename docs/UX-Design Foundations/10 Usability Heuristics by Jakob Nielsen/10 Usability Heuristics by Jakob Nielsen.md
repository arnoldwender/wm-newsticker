Jakob Nielsen has defined 10 usability heuristics — broad principles for usability — that create better user experiences.++[[1]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-1)++ Think of these as rules of thumb for designing user interfaces that are intuitive to users to interact with.  
Nielsen’s usability heuristics are general principles, not specific guidelines. They should guide you in creating a user experience that feels intuitive and clear to people visiting your website or using your products. The goal is to create an interface that’s delightful for users while clearly orienting them on their journey.  
**EXERCISE #1**  
## Visibility of system status  
##   
  
  
  
  
The visibility of system status refers to how well a system's state is conveyed to users. An ideal system should always keep users informed about what is going on through appropriate feedback within a reasonable time.  
Visibility of system status heuristic means it’s important for users to understand what’s happening when they take an action. Giving immediate feedback on actions is vital to achieving this end. When users take an action and expect something to happen, they need to be informed of the status of that action. Feedback should be immediate and could be done via graphics, animations, or sounds.  
**There are 4 possible feedback types a good system should provide:**  
* What has just happened?  
* Where am I?  
* What is happening?  
* What will happen next?  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #2**  
## Match between the system and the real world  
##   
  
  
  
  
A match between the system and the real world means the system should speak users' language, with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms.  
Jargon and system-oriented terms in your designs are a turn-off to users. Make sure the words, phrases, and concepts you use are familiar to your users. Real-world resemblance orients users to the new environment and makes them more comfortable. Consider the ubiquity of the magnifying glass for the search icon or using a “Join the Community” button instead of “Sign Up.”  
**Pro Tip:** Jargon can be an exception for some domains and target audiences. Legal or medical products, for example, will be challenging to use without professional jargon.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #3**  
## User control and freedom  
##   
  
  
  
  
The user control and freedom heuristic implies that users naturally make errors and mistakes when interacting with a system or change their mind and want to revert an action. It's crucial to provide an "emergency exit" so they can leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue.  
We're only humans, after all, and we make mistakes or have second thoughts and decide to alter our decisions. When people know they can undo or cancel an undesirable action, they feel more relaxed and comfortable. Ensure the exit is easy to spot and has a straightforward label that eliminates any doubts about what happens when users click it.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #4**  
## Consistency and standards  
##   
  
  
  
  
Consistency and standards across your interface help ensure that users will never question or wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Create standards for how you use each element within your design, from colors to icons, and keep them consistent throughout the site.  
There are 4 types of consistency designers should consider when working on their projects:  
* **Visual: **visually consistent elements like buttons, menus, labels, fonts, etc., help users learn the ropes of the product faster.  
* **Functional: **the same controls and components should function similarly. It makes a system more predictable and helps users feel safer and relaxed.  
* **Internal: **this type includes both visual and functional consistency within a specific product.  
* **External: **this type includes both visual and functional consistency across multiple systems/products. For example, all Google products use the same fonts, icons, or colors, and similar components, e.g., a search bar, function similarly.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #5**  
## Error prevention  
##   
  
  
  
  
Error prevention is the principle that good systems should prevent mistakes, rather than trying to correct them after the fact. Gently guide your users through their journey by showing suggestions, providing smart defaults, and applying constraints where necessary (such as when filling out form inputs). At the same time, make it easy for users to change their minds throughout the journey.  
Generally, there are two types of errors users make:  
* **Slips** occur accidentally when you want to take one action but end up doing it wrong. For example, when you type "bisycle" instead of "bicycle." To prevent slips, you can use input constraints, provide helpful suggestions, or use forgiving input formatting.  
* **Mistakes** happen as a result of conscious users' actions. They happen when users have wrong expectations or knowledge of how the functionality actually works. For example, when you want to click a button that is a non-interactive banner.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #6**  
## Recognition rather than recall  
##   
  
  
  
  
The recognition rather than recall heuristic means that we should always minimize the load on a user's memory by making actions, elements, and options clearly visible. Don’t make your users remember what each button does. Recognition works better and more efficiently than memory. A familiar interface is a recognizable one, so match real-world interactions and experiences whenever possible.  
**Pro Tip:** This principle goes hand in hand with matching the real world, as a familiar interface is a recognizable one.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #7**  
## Flexibility and efficiency of use  
##   
  
  
  
  
The flexibility and efficiency of use heuristic means that systems should be versatile enough to accommodate the different needs of both advanced users and newcomers. By default, show the most common functions and keep the advanced options for your more experienced audience.  
For example, shortcuts may significantly simplify task implementation for more advanced users, while tips and clear labels can help novice users complete the same task.  
Flexible interfaces also allow users to customize functions to their specific needs. For example, in Photoshop, users can tailor their workspace and keep at hand panels and tools they swear by repeatedly.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #8**  
## Aesthetic and minimalist design  
##   
  
  
  
  
The aesthetic and minimalist design principle means interfaces should not contain irrelevant information or elements which don't add value.  
As Steve Jobs said, "Design is not just what it looks like or feels like. Design is how it works." That's true, but apart from its visual appeal, an aesthetic and minimalist design helps prioritize content, making the most relevant stand out. Clean up interfaces by getting rid of everything that doesn't help users complete their tasks or, worse — prevent them from achieving a goal.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #9**  
## Help users recognize and recover from errors  
##   
  
  
  
  
To help users recognize and recover from errors, the system should alert users in concise and simple language, clearly indicate the problem, and provide some solutions.  
Don’t leave users wondering what to do if they encounter an error or make a mistake. Good error messages explicitly tell users what happened, how to fix it, and how to move forward. Give users constructive advice, but feel free to make error messages friendly and empathetic.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #10**  
## Help and documentation  
##   
  
The help and documentation heuristic means that the system should make it easy to find additional information when needed. Good design is familiar and easy to understand — but sometimes, your users will need a little nudge. The best way is to be proactive and offer help when users actually ask for it, like contextual tips or onboarding screens.  
However, most users frivolously skip this educational part, and it's crucial to ensure help documentation or tutorials are easy to find when users get stuck and need some help. Ultimately, design to remove the need for help documentation but include it nonetheless.  
  
  
  
  
  
**EXERCISE #11**  
## The heuristic evaluation process  
##   
  
Nielsen’s heuristics are just one set of design heuristics. There are several others like ++[Shneiderman’s Eight Golden Rules](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/shneiderman-s-eight-golden-rules-will-help-you-design-better-interfaces)++ and ++[Gerhardt-Powals' cognitive engineering principles](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Heuristic_evaluation#/Gerhardt-Powals'_cognitive_engineering_principles)++. Pick what fits your product. Here's how to use them for evaluating usability:  
1. **Define your goals:** Know which interface aspects you're evaluating for usability issues.  
2. **Gather materials:** Collect design docs, prototypes, and user research to understand the context.  
3. **Conduct evaluations:** Get 3-5 experts to assess each heuristic, noting any issues.  
4. **Rate issues:** Have experts gauge the severity of issues based on impact, frequency, and user frustration.  
5. **Compile findings:** Merge all evaluations to see overlapping issues and prioritize them.  
6. **Share results:** Discuss the findings with stakeholders to guide necessary changes.++[[2]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-2)++
